# sVim
Vim bindings for Safari. I use [cVim](https://github.com/1995eaton/chromium-vim) in Chrome, but there is no good match for it in Safari. sVim is an attempt to make that match.

## sVimrc
- The sVimrc page is where you can customize sVim settings and css.
- You can access the page by pressing "g v" or via the extension settings in Safari.
- The sVimrc and sVimcss files can be synced via [gist](https://gist.github.com).
 - The gist id is found at the end of the url when viewing the gist.
 - Note it does not matter the name of your gist or the file, sVim will just grab the first file from the gist id supplied. I use sVim.rc and sVim.css.
